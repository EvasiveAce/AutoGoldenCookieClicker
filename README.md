# Auto Golden Cookie Clicker 

This program is for the idle-based browser game "Cookie Clicker" by Orteil, created to automatically click golden cookies. I developed this app so I could get the [golden cookie achievements](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Cookie_Achievements) easier, and without a third party plugin. 

## Getting Started
> Please know that it only detects contract golden cookies. The fix for this is to enable the [Business Day Season](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Business_Day_season), or replace the normal golden cookie image in ```D:..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Cookie Clicker\resources\app\src\img```, with this image:
>
> ![goldCookie](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95405c2f-6ed7-445d-b1a5-cda597abcdfc)
>
> Make sure it has the filename ```goldCookie.png```.

### Running Locally
1.  Once you have contract golden cookies spawning, open the exe file by downloading it [here](https://github.com/EvasiveAce/AutoGoldenCookieClicker/releases/tag/1.0).
2.  Simply press Start, and then click on your main monitor to start the automatic clicking.
